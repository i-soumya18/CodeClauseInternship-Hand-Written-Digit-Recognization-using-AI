# Digit Recognition Project

The digit recognition project is an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) application developed using Python and Tkinter, a Python library for creating user interfaces. This project employs the power of generative AI technology, utilizing the Google Generative AI library to recognize handwritten digits from user-uploaded images.

## Overview

This application provides an intuitive interface that allows users to upload an image containing a handwritten digit. The uploaded image is displayed in one section of the interface. Subsequently, the application utilizes a pre-trained generative AI model to predict the handwritten digit represented in the image. The predicted digit is then showcased in another section of the GUI.

## Features

- **User Image Upload**: Users can upload an image file containing a handwritten digit.
- **Image Display**: The uploaded image is displayed within the application for user reference.
- **Digit Recognition**: The application uses a pre-trained generative AI model to predict the digit represented in the uploaded image.
- **Predicted Digit Display**: The predicted digit is showcased to the user within the GUI.
